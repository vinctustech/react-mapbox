## react-mapbox

**react-mapbox** is a very minimalist React.js wrapper library for the 
[Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) 
Typescript library.

Documentation can be found [here](https://vinctustech.github.io/react-mapbox/).

Testing
-------
There is a test program in the `test` directory. It gets the Mapbox access token from environment variable
`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY` which can be defined in `.env.development`.

To start the test program type:
1. ```
   npm i```
2. ```
   tsc```
3. ```
   cd test```
4. ```
   npm i```
5. ```
   npm start```
